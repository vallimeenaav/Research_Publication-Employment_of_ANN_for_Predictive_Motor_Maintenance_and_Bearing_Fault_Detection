## Overview
This project leverages **Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA)** combined with **Park's Vector Analysis** and **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** to classify the health of three-phase industrial motors. It addresses the challenges of real-time, non-invasive motor fault detection using lightweight and computationally efficient solutions that can be deployed on edge devices.

### Key Contributions:
- **Non-invasive predictive maintenance**: Utilizes motor current signals instead of invasive sensors.
- **Lightweight ANN classifier**: Optimized to run on low-cost hardware like Raspberry Pi.
- **Industrial impact**: Real-time motor health monitoring in remote or resource-constrained environments.

## Problem Statement
Industrial motors, particularly induction motors, experience significant wear and tear over time. Bearing faults constitute over 40% of motor failures and can lead to costly downtime. Existing methods for fault detection are either invasive, expensive, or lack accuracy.

### Objectives:
1. Design a non-invasive system for bearing fault detection using motor current signals.
2. Implement a lightweight ANN model for fault classification.
3. Deploy the model on edge devices like Raspberry Pi for real-time use.
